- <b>[Designing Network topology](https://imgur.com/a/Gwse4Nd) </b>
    - Description: Designed and implemented basic network topologies using Packet Tracer.
 Connected devices and configured basic device settings.
 Tested network connectivity by pinging devices within the network.
 Explored additional features of Packet Tracer, such as configuring interfaces and VLANs.
 Created and saved multiple network topologies for future reference.
- <b>[Designing a Network and configuring a routing protocols in the network](https://imgur.com/a/uUfmJKo) </b>
    - Description: Successfully created a network topology with multiple routers and switches.
‚Ä¢	Configured IP addresses on router interfaces and enabled IP routing.
‚Ä¢	Implemented static routing by defining static routes between routers.
‚Ä¢	Configured and enabled a dynamic routing protocol such as RIP or OSPF.
‚Ä¢	Verified the routing table on each router and observed correct route advertisements.
‚Ä¢	Tested network connectivity by successfully pinging between devices in different networks.
‚Ä¢	Analysed the behaviour of the routing protocols and observed route changes or updates.
- <b>[Designing a Network with different lan and configuring a routing protocols](https://imgur.com/a/3WmfA0n)</b>
    - Description: In a real-world scenario using Cisco Packet Tracer, designing a network comprising routers, switches, and end devices. Created two distinct LAN networks with separate IP addressing schemes and ensure the ability to transfer packets between them.
  
- <b>[Bash Script of analyzing access logs](https://imgur.com/a/4mlwlL6)</b>
    - Description: This home lab is to create a bash script that provide a basic system monitoring functionality. It collects and displays key system metrics, including CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space utilization.

- <b>[Bash Script of a system monitoring](https://imgur.com/iliLD9V)</b>
    - Description: This home lab is to create a script that focuses on the analysis of Apache access logs. It aim to identify the most frequently accessed URLs, providind insights into web traffic patterns. The Script specifies the path to the Apache access log file, extracts URLs from the log, and displays the top most accessed URLs.

- <b>[User and Permission Management, System Information, and Process Management](https://imgur.com/a/TQg3iMU)</b>
    - Description: In this lab assignment, the aim was to practice user and permission management commands, as well as system information and process management commands in the Linux terminal. These commands allow me to manage users, permissions, system information, running processes, and perform system operations efficiently. By mastering these commands, i gained better control over user management, system monitoring, and resource management in a Linux environment.
- <b>[Network Enumeration.](https://imgur.com/a/iPRyIJ8)</b>
    - Description: This lab allowed me to gain hands-on experience in network scanning and enumeration. I learned how to use the nmap tool for network discovery and explored different scanning techniques. Additionally, i understood the significance of enumeration and how to utilize enumeration techniques and tools for information gathering.
1. nmap -p 80 --script=http-enum.nse birchwood.org
Nmap is used to enumerate HTTP information on port 80 of the target host using the http-enum.nse script.
2. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) can be used to query information from network devices. The snmpwalk command can be used to retrieve SNMP information.
snmpwalk -c public -v2c birchwood.org
This command queries the birchwood.org (137.114.14.145) address using the SNMP community string "public" and version 2c.
3. DNS Enumeration Tools (e.g dnsenum):
DNS enumeration tools like dnsenum can be used to gather information about DNS records, subdomains, and zone transfers.
rust
dnsenum birchwood.org
This command performs DNS enumeration on the " birchwood.org " domain to identify subdomains and DNS-related information.
4. Automated Enumeration Scripts:
"enum4linux" are designed to extract information from Windows systems.
enum4linux -a birchwood.org
This command runs enum4linux on the birchwood.org to gather information about Windows systems, including users, shares, and more.
SMTP Enumeration Tools (e.g., smtp-user-enum):
5. SMTP enumeration tools are used to identify valid email addresses on a mail server. One such tool is smtp-user-enum.
smtp-user-enum -M VRFY -U /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_users.txt -t birchwood.com -o output.txt
This command performs SMTP user enumeration using the VRFY method and a wordlist of potential usernames.
